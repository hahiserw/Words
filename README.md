Shows translation of another word from your dictionary

I use it as motd. It helps me learn some english words.
It's like fortune in slackware.


What can you do with that?

- show translation of current pointed word (awesome!)
- add words through comman line or stdin (everytime you that backup is made)
- shuffle dictionary (it happens automatically when last word is reached)

You can also add '-v' for more verbose output.
